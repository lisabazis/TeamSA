# TeamSA

This GitHub Repository is home to our semester project for Software Assurance at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where we are graduate students enrolled in the Cybersecurity program. This project involves contributing to an open source community and addressing the security needs of its end users in the intended threat environment of the deployed software. To this end, we chose to contribute to [Zulip](https://zulip.org/), a real-time chat and productivity application, similar to Slack with support for threaded conversation.
